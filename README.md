# pincode-based-locking-mechanism-on-proteus-using-pic16F8777a
this is a pincode based locking mechanism which is simulated on proteus, pic16F877a is used , and an led is used to simulate the lock. It has a buzzer based robbery alarm mechanism which is triggerd after 3 consecutive wrong attempts. the master code to change the pincode is 00007.
the circuit is made on proteus
the code is compiled on MikroC,
libraries used by project on MikroC- eeprom,keypad,lcd,lcd_const,pic
LED represents the lock in this simulation,
 in hardware application, relays can be used to create a physical lock.
